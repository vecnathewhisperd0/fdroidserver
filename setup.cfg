# All this below is for Babel config.  Ideally we would only use
# Babel, but it is still missing some key features that gettext gives
# us.  So for now, this Babel setup is just to make it easy for Python
# people who are used to it.  Babel is missing:
#
# * properly tagging various Python formats in the comments
# * --add-location=file
# * --join-existing
# * --sort-output on update
#
# So for now the canonical way to update the template and translation
# files is: `make -C locale`
