AutoName: Fake OTA Update
Summary: Tests whether OTA ZIP files are being include
Description: |-
    F-Droid can make use of system privileges or permissions to
    install, update and remove applications on its own. The only way to obtain those
    privileges is to become a system app.

    This is where the Privileged Extension comes in - being a separate app and much
    smaller, it can be installed as a system app and communicate with the main app
    via AIDL IPC.

    This has several advantages:

    * Reduced disk usage in the system partition
    * System updates don't remove F-Droid
    * The process of installing into system via root is safer

    This is packaged as an OTA (Over-The-Air) update ZIP file.  It must be installed
    using TWRP or other Android recovery that can flash updates to the system from
    the /data/data/org.fdroid.fdroid folder on the /data partition. The standalone
    APK is called F-Droid Privileged Extension.
