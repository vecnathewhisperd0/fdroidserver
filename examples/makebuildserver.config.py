# In the process of setting up the build server, many gigs of files

# these are stored in ~/.cache/fdroidserver
#
# cachedir = 'buildserver/cache'

# A big part of creating a new instance is downloading packages from Debian.
# This setups up a folder in ~/.cache/fdroidserver to cache the downloaded
# packages when rebuilding the build server from scratch.  This requires
# that virtualbox-guest-utils is installed.

# The buildserver can use some local caches to speed up builds,
# especially when the internet connection is slow and/or expensive.
# If enabled, the buildserver setup will look for standard caches in
# your HOME dir and copy them to the buildserver VM. Be aware: this
# will reduce the isolation of the buildserver from your host machine,
# so the buildserver will provide an environment only as trustworthy
# as the host machine's environment.

# default it uses http.debian.net, which auto-detects which is the
